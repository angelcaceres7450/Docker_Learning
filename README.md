## What is Docker?

Docker is an open source program that allows a Linux application and its dependencies to be packaged as a container.

Container-based virtualization isolates applications from each other on a shared operating system (OS). This approach standardizes the delivery of the application program, allowing applications to run in any Linux environment, whether physical or virtual. Since they share the same operating system, containers are portable between different Linux distributions, and are significantly smaller than virtual machine (VM) images.
